# Components Directory

This directory contains all reusable React components used across the application.

## Structure

- `ui/` - Basic UI components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.)
- `forms/` - Form-related components
- `layout/` - Layout components (headers, footers, navigation)
- `auth/` - Authentication-related components
- `common/` - Other shared components

## Best Practices

- Each component should be in its own directory with index.ts export
- Include component-specific types in the same directory
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow the project's naming conventions
